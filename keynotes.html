			<h3 style="text-align:left;">Recommender Systems: Business Value and Measurements</h3>
			<p style="font-size:.75em;text-align:left;font-weight:300;"><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
			Recommender Systems are one of the most visible and successful applications of Artificial Intelligence technology. Today, all major online sites provide personalized suggestions to their users. These recommendations can both be helpful for users and beneficial for the providers of these services. Academic research is mostly focused on the value of recommenders for the user; the value perspective of business, in contrast, is less explored. In this talk, we will review the various ways how recommender systems can create value, both for users and providers, and how this value contribution can be measured. We will furthermore discuss limitations of academic research in this context and outline potential ways forward.</p>
